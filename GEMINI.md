# Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application designed to help users track their expenses. The project consists of a .NET backend, an Angular frontend, and a React frontend. It also includes a background service for data processing and a desktop UI.

The application allows users to manage their expenses by organizing them into businesses and categories. It provides features for:
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting businesses and categories.
- Assigning categories to businesses.
- Importing raw transaction data.
- Generating reports on spending, such as monthly summaries and pie charts.

## Project Structure

- **`SmartSpender.DAL.BL`**: A class library that contains the business logic of the application.
- **`SmartSpender.Core`**: A class library that contains the core entities, DTOs, and interfaces.
- **`SmartSpender.BE`**: A background worker service that performs data processing tasks.
- **`SmartSpender.UI`**: An Avalonia desktop application.
- **`SmartSpender.WEB`**: An Angular single-page application that provides the user interface for the application.
- **`SmartSpender.WEB.React`**: A React single-page application.
